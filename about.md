Hmm, I'm Khanh, Ta Quang Khanh (1994) for full name, now (2015) is 4th year student at Cryptography Academy. I was interested in computer as child. I realized I quite lazy, so didn't do anything completely.

Most people who saw me said that I was more handsome than any girl, and so infantine :buon:. 

I will write some post mostly for anything what I learn at school, or some experience about coding, computer or any feel about life.
